"""Partition a repository's compression into five categories, in a fixed order.

Identity is by NAME.  Two declarations with the same name before and after are
assumed to be the same declaration; a statement-level comparison would be
stronger but needs the comparator, so this is the working assumption and one to
revisit.

Every retained declaration whose text changed is split into hunks (maximal runs
of changed lines, see proof_hunks.py).  The scored token count is a per-line
sum, so hunk deltas partition the declaration's delta, and the first two
categories are offsets taken off individual hunks before anything else looks at
the declaration:

  1. SYNTAX OPTIMIZATION.  (a) The macro-expanded tree: what notation, macros
     and inlined definitions saved at their call sites, net of what declaring
     them cost (syntax_by_node.json).  (b) Spelling rules applied per hunk --
     ``simp only [..]`` -> ``simp``, ``have h : T :=`` -> ``have h :=``, merged
     ``rw``/``intro`` calls, ``by exact``, dot notation, redundant parentheses,
     binders hoisted into ``variable`` ... -- each accepted only when it lies on
     a shortest token-edit path from the old hunk to the new one.

  2. AUTOMATION.  A hunk whose proof was manual (it cited lemmas, rewrote,
     applied) and is now only automation (``simp``, ``grind``, ``omega``,
     ``nlinarith [..]`` ...) and goal routing: its post-syntax delta.

  3. DEAD CODE.  Deleted declarations nothing that survived used: no retained
     declaration reaches them through the old graph, directly or through a
     chain of other deleted declarations.  A component rule -- even one taken
     among deleted declarations only -- glues an unused cluster to live code
     through a shared helper that was itself deleted but live (gemini
     palomar__2026-08-28-000002: the whole ``Localization.*`` cluster hung off
     ``Submonoid.le_nonZeroDivisors``).  That component count is still
     reported as ``dead_code_component``.

  4. STRUCTURAL CHANGE.  The dependency graph changed:
       + every deleted declaration that was live (not dead code)
       + the remainder of each retained declaration whose dependency set
         changed (new dependencies other than syntax abbreviations, or lost
         dependencies not explained by an automation hunk)
       - the tokens of every new declaration that is not a syntax abbreviation

  5. PROOF REWRITING.  The remainder of each retained declaration whose
     dependency set did not change.

Precedence is strict: tokens claimed by an earlier step are never reclaimed by
a later one.

The paper's settings are the defaults: ledger accounting (ledger.py) and step
automation (proof_hunks.step_automation). Run on the index that
extract_paper_graphs.py writes; a failed submission scores zero:

    python scripts/analysis/classify_compression.py <graphs>/classification-inputs.csv --output-dir <dir>

It writes classification-repositories.csv and diff_classification_macro.csv
(equal-weight means, the paper's figure data; plot_compression_origin.py draws
it) and classification.json with every repository's detail.
