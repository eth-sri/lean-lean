"""Price the macros that compute their own expansion, by running them.

Some of what a model writes is not an abbreviation.  One repository encodes a
table of 132 signed integers as a base-62 string and writes a ``macro_rules``
that decodes it at elaboration time: ``integerRow% "0000w0001O..."`` is five
scored tokens standing in for three hundred and seventy-five.  Another writes
command macros that emit whole proof blocks from a handful of numeric arguments.
Neither is a re-spelling of a proof -- one changes how data is represented and
the other generates proof script -- so they are measured here and reported as
their own bucket rather than folded into the notation leg.

These cannot be expanded by pattern substitution, because the right-hand side is
a ``MacroM`` program rather than a template.  They do not need to be: the program
is exactly what Lean runs, so this generates a standalone Lean file holding the
repository's new syntax commands verbatim, asks Lean to take *one* macro step at
each call site, and reads the result back.

Three things make that cheap.  The macro bodies use core Lean only -- the
constants in their output have to parse, not elaborate -- so no Mathlib, no
repository build and no container are involved.  One step rather than a fixpoint
is the counterfactual actually wanted: recursing would also expand Lean's own
list and numeral notation, turning ``[29, 43]`` into ``List.cons`` and pricing a
world without Lean's syntax instead of a world without the model's.  And macro
hygiene marks the identifiers it introduces, which the scoring lexer would count
as extra tokens, so the marks are stripped before anything is measured.

An ``elab`` is out of reach here: it runs in ``CommandElabM`` with environment
effects rather than in ``MacroM``, and several of them call helper functions
defined elsewhere in the repository.  Those are reported as uncovered.
